# Predictive Modeling of Charge Levels for Battery Electric Vehicles using CNN (EfficientNet)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been a good solution for understanding a vast image dataset. As the increased number of battery-equipped electric vehicles is flourishing globally, there has been much research on understanding which charge levels electric vehicle drivers would choose to charge their vehicles to get to their destination without any prevention. We implemented deep learning approaches to analyze the tabular datasets to understand their state of charge and which charge levels they would choose. In addition, we implemented the Image Generator for Tabular Dataset algorithm to utilize tabular datasets as image datasets to train convolutional neural networks. Also, we integrated other CNN architecture such as EfficientNet to prove that CNN is a great learner for reading information from images that were converted from the tabular dataset, and able to predict charge levels for battery-equipped electric vehicles. We also evaluated several optimization methods to enhance the learning rate of the models and examined further analysis on improving the model architecture.
